# Smart Home Intranet

## The What? ##

What's this exciting new project you're working on you ask?  Glad you did, this is a smart home intanet site.  For anyone that doens't know intranet is where the site is on an internal network.  I am accessing this site from my house and no-one has access to the site outside my house.

The site itself is just a simple site that gives details about my smart home.  

## The Why? ##

Sometimes you may have companie or friends over at your house and they are interested in your smart home.  Or (the more real scenario) you want to show someone your smart home setup. Sometimes you can't remember all the commands and features.  That's where this site comes in handy.  You whip out your smartphone or computer and you have access to all the information.  To get to the site you just punch in the url and there it is!

## The Challenge ##

This was also kind of a challenge for myself.  I wanted to completely write the code on a small Linux computer that I have that's running Zorin OS.  The computer only has 32 gigs of ram and 4 gigs of memory.  It actually runs everything just fine.  Linux is awesome!
